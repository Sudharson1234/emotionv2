# UI Redesign TODO

## Overview
Convert the entire application UI to a light theme and implement a new "Organic Skeuomorphic Morphism" design template. This includes skeuomorphic elements (realistic depth and textures) with unique morphing animations for a futuristic, organic feel.

## Steps
- [ ] Read all HTML templates to understand current styles
- [ ] Edit index.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit userpage.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit login.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit signup.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit chat.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit analytics.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit image_detection.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit video_detection.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit text_detection.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit live_chat.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Edit multi_language.html: Apply light theme, skeuomorphic styles, and morphing animations
- [ ] Update static/style.css for consistency if needed
- [ ] Test responsiveness and accessibility
- [ ] Run app locally to verify changes

## Design Principles
- Light backgrounds (whites, soft grays), dark text
- Skeuomorphic elements: Raised buttons/cards with shadows, inset effects for depth
- Morphing animations: Subtle shape changes on hover (e.g., scaling, slight rotation, flowing transitions)
- Unique touch: Organic floating shapes, textured backgrounds (e.g., paper-like), liquid-like morphs
- Responsive design maintained
